# RowanSample9 - spec_0061
### Component Structure Examples
The specs **spec_0061**, **spec_0062** and **spec_0063** provide examples of different conventions for organizing component structure.
The code in this set of specs use the same set of packages:
- RowanSample9-Core-Loader
- RowanSample9-Core-Projects
- RowanSample9-Core-Rowan
- RowanSample9-Core-Core
- RowanSample9-Core-Examples
- RowanSample9-Loader-GemStone
- RowanSample9-Loader-Pharo
- RowanSample9-Tests

and differ only in how the components are organized.
#### spec_0061
The components in this spec are organized using directory structure and common component basenames to isolate the conditional components.
#### spec_0062

#### spec_0063


### Description
Package Group Example 1: define using only packages, including references to conditional packages. Start with master; create a collection of classes and packages to populate the following packageGroups: Projects, Loader, Rowan, Examples, Tests, and WorkGroups; where Loader will reference all packages directly, including a couple of platform specific packages; WorkGroups contains a developer defined set of packages that represent a personal working set and will contain at least one package that is not already in a group plus at least one package that IS already in a group.

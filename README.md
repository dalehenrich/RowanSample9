# RowanSample9 - spec_0015
Starting with spec_0014, remove the old (now empty) package from the project as triggering a package move
	as opposed to a class move seems to trigger the bug, which implies that move package is not quite right. 

	It seems that assigning a new symbol dictionary to the OLD package ... the package that the class is moved FROM
	may trigger a bogus package move.

	The test RwRowanProjectIssuesTestV2 >> testIssue495_move_class_and_extension_method_to_new_symbol_dict
	showed that #493 wasn't fixed by the V2 implementation.

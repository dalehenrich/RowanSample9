# RowanSample9 - spec_0069
Start with spec_0000 (RowanSample9) and add Parent, Child and Bridge top-level components with corresponding packages. The Bridge component is not expected to be loaded with the Parent component, because it has a required project conflict.

The Parent package has an AbstractRowanSample9ParentClass1 class. RowanSample12:spec_0005 requires RowanSample9:spec_0069 and has a RowanSample12ConcreteClass1 class that suclasses AbstractRowanSample9ParentClass1. 

The Child package has a concrete class that subclasses RowanSample10Class1, making RowanSample10:spec0001 a required project. 

The Bridge package has an AbstractRowanSample9BridgeClass1 class that is a subclass of AbstractRowanSample11ParentClass1 from RowanSample11:spec_0005. The class AbstractRowanSample9BridgeClass1 has subclass RowanSample12ConcreteClass1 from the project RowanSample12:spec_0006 that requires RowanSample9:spec_0069. AbstractRowanSample9BridgeClass1 has a method #foo that is implemented with subclassResponsibility and #foo is defined in RowanSample12ConcreteClass1.

Each of the components in RowanSample9:spec_0069 has a corresponding test case that confirms the class structure.

# RowanSample9 - spec_0012
Starting with spec_0011, move extension method to a new extension package; move class package to a 
		different symbol dict; move new extension package to a third symbol dictionary. This is an illegal combination
		(extension method and class in different symbol dictionaries) and does cause an error.
